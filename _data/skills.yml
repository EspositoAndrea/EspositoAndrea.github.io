  I'm a Computer Science student and I love constantly
  challenging myself learning new programming languages. 
  So, sometimes, i like to self-evaluate my skills.
skills-levels:
  - name: "C/C++"
    level: 85
    level-text: "Good"
    tooltip: "C++ was my first programming language, so I'm studying it since 2012."
  - name: "L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X"
    level: 80
    level-text: "Good"
    tooltip: "I love the way LaTeX documents look."
  - name: "HTML5 &amp; CSS3"
    level: 75
    level-text: "Above average"
    tooltip: "Well, you're looking at something I modified using HTML and CSS, so..."
  - name: "Python"
    level: 70
    level-text: "Above average"
    tooltip: "Though I don't really like this language, I can still use it."
  - name: "RegEx &amp; Automata"
    level: 90
    level-text: "Very good"
    tooltip: "RegEx and Automata are not languages, but I love them and I'm good at them so why not."
